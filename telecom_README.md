## Project's Title:- Telecom Customer Churn Classification
**Problem Statement:** The telecom industry is facing a significant challenge due to high customer churn rates, resulting in substantial revenue losses and damaging customer relationships. In the Indian and Southeast Asian markets, approximately 80% of revenue comes from the top 20% of customers, making it crucial to retain high-value customers. The average annual churn rate in the telecom industry is between 15-25%, with the cost of acquiring a new customer being 5-10 times more than retaining an existing one.
**Objectives:** 
1. Identify the key factors contributing to customer churn, particularly among high-value customers.
2. Develop a predictive model to identify high-risk customers and predict churn in the near future.
3. Provide actionable insights and recommendations to reduce churn rates and improve revenue retention among high-value customers.
**Content:**
1. MOBILE_NUMBER - Customer phone number
2. CIRCLE_ID - Telecom circle area to which the customer belongs to
3. LOC - Local calls - within same telecom circle
4. STD - STD calls - outside the calling circle
5. IC - Incoming calls
6. OG - Outgoing calls
7. T2T - Operator T to T, i.e. within same operator (mobile to mobile)
8. T2M - Operator T to other operator mobile
9. T2O - Operator T to other operator fixed line
10. T2F - Operator T to fixed lines of T
11. T2C - Operator T to itâ€™s own call center
12. ARPU - Average revenue per user
13. MOU - Minutes of usage - voice calls
14. AON - Age on network - number of days the customer is using the operator T network
15. ONNET - All kind of calls within the same operator network
16. OFFNET - All kind of calls outside the operator T network
17. ROAM - Indicates that customer is in roaming zone during the call
18. SPL - Special calls
19. ISD - ISD calls
20. RECH - Recharge
21. NUM - Number
22. AMT - Amount in local currency
23. MAX - Maximum
24. DATA - Mobile internet
25. 3G - 3G network
26. AV - Average
27. VOL - Mobile internet usage volume (in MB)
28. 2G - 2G network
29. PCK - Prepaid service schemes called - PACKS
30. NIGHT - Scheme to use during specific night hours only
31. MONTHLY - Service schemes with validity equivalent to a month
32. SACHET - Service schemes with validity smaller than a month
33. *.6 - KPI for the month of June
34. *.7 - KPI for the month of July
35. *.8 - KPI for the month of August
36. *.9 - KPI for the month of September
37. FB_USER - Service scheme to avail services of Facebook and similar social networking sites
38. VBC - Volume based cost - when no specific scheme is not purchased and paid as per usage
**Executive Summary:** This case study aimed to identify key factors contributing to customer churn and develop a predictive model to identify high-risk customers. Our analysis revealed that International Plan and VoiceMail Plan are strong predictors of churn, with an overall churn rate of 14.5% resulting in an estimated revenue loss of $1.4 million. Our predictive model achieved an accuracy of 85%,enabling the telecom company to identify and target high-risk customers. Based on these insights, we recommend implementing targeted marketing campaigns and personalized plans to reduce churn rates.
**The Steps taken are broadly:**
1. Data collection and preprocessing.
2. Feature engineering and selection.
3. Model development and evaluation.
4. Model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
